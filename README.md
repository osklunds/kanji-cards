todo: introduction

# Source code overview

The "main" function of this program is the test case `run_main` located in `create_card_tests.cpp`. `run_main` in turn uses the other files and classes. See each header file for more details about each file.

# Building, running, testing

Run `./build_run_test.sh` located in the root level of this repository to, well, build the project and run the tests. Run `./build_run_test run_main` to run the main function that generates the kanji cards. The outout is located in `build/out`.
