# Copyright, license, attribution

This project uses assets from external projects. They are stored as copies inside `ext_assets` alongside copyright files. Some of the external assets have been copied/modified. Those modified copies are stored inside `int_assets`.

The license for my work here is GPL v3, as specified by the separate `LICENSE` file. I don't claim any copyright or contribution to files in `ext_assets`, so those files are not covered by `LICENSE`. I simply redistribute them together with this repo to make building, testing and running my code simpler and more self-contained.

No copyright infringement intended. If you see an issue, I'm more than happy to fix it.
