# stroke order sketch

For the kanji, translate to unicode codepoint and find the svg file

For each stroke in the svg file, delete one by one, and save as new svg file. Also delete unwanted elements, and mark the start point of the current stroke.

Convert the new svg files to png. Now they can be drawn using libharu.
