This project generates cards aimed for studying Kanji. Each card contains

- The Kanji in question
- The number of the Kanji, in order of (approximate) frequency of occurrence
- Stroke order diagrams, showing how to write the Kanji
- Meanings of the Kanji
- On'yomi readings of the Kanji
- Kun'yomi readings of the Kanji
- Words containing the Kanji, in order of (approximate) frequency of occurrence, including the word in kanji, the word's reading and the word's meanings

See the below example of two cards.

The cards are PDF files. They have a shape aimed at being looked at from a smartphone. See the section `Building, running, testing` for information on how to generate the cards.

This project uses some external data sources and fonts. See the section `Copyright, license, attribution` for more information.

# Source code overview

The "main" function of this program is the test case `run_main` located in `create_card_tests.cpp`. `run_main` in turn uses the other files and classes. See each header file for more details about each file.

# Building, running, testing

Run `./build_run_test.sh` located in the root level of this repository to, well, build the project and run the tests. Run `./build_run_test run_main` to run the main function that generates the kanji cards. The output is located in `build/out`.
